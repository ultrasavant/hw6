The source code files and Makefile under this directory was used during lectures on 11/23/2022.

This is the reference implementation for HW#6. Please see the ecs36b_hw6.json for the input arguments for all four functions --
(1) obtain    - obtain a new or existing game (and obtain a valid game_id)
(2) guess     - provide a guess to a particular game_id
(3) set_name  - select a name for your group (input: student IDs)
(4) submit    - after completing a game, submit the game_id with your team name

IMPORTANT:
During our classes, we will use the following ngrok link --
https://5f43-2601-200-c001-9ff0-d5cd-ca2a-e2c4-2fcc.ngrok.io

I.e., in hw6client.cpp, you should have --
HttpClient httpclient("https://5f43-2601-200-c001-9ff0-d5cd-ca2a-e2c4-2fcc.ngrok.io");

If you have any question about the examples, please feel free to ask the instructor.
